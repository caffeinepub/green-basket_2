# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update all user-facing frontend copy from “Ready to Cut” to “Ready to Cook” across Fresh Bites 49 while keeping behavior, styling, pricing, and checkout unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace every frontend occurrence of the exact text “Ready to Cut” with “Ready to Cook” (section headings, product titles, category labels/tiles, and any navigation/menu labels).
- Update any visible navigation/scroll-target labels so the UI consistently shows “Ready to Cook” and still navigates to the correct section.
- Ensure product names reflected in the cart and WhatsApp checkout naturally show “Ready to Cook” where they previously included “Ready to Cut”, without changing cart behavior or WhatsApp URL/message structure.

**User-visible outcome:** Everywhere the site previously displayed “Ready to Cut” now displays “Ready to Cook” with identical styling, navigation still scrolls correctly, and cart + WhatsApp checkout work the same (with updated product names where applicable).
